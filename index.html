    <ul class="crew row">
        <li class="crew-item col-6">Philip J. Fry is a dim-witted
            man from the 20th century who gets frozen for 1,000 years, thawing out on New Year's Eve 2999. His character
            is largely an attempt by the show's creators to make the connection between the 20th century and the 31st
            century much easier for the viewers. Often, Fry is faced with differences in the future, which he then
            relates to things in his time. As a result, he frequently has to defend the actions of the 20th century.
            Fry loves video games, and as such, he is usually shown to be very good at them, although not all games. He
            never actually managed to finish the final enemy on Space Invaders; he always had to get his brother Yancy
            to do it for him. Though he may not be good at all games, his skills have made him a crackshot, and he
            usually mans the ship's weapons when they are under attack. He has also got a lot better at fighting, by
            "Fun on a Bun" Also, Fry absolutely loves sewers, he once surfed (was surprisingly good) in various sewers
            around Earth cities with Turanga Morris & Bender, but got temporarily sick as a result.

        <li class="crew-item col-6">Bender Bending Rodriguez
            Bender Bending Rodriguez (Model: bending unit 22) is a bending unit (serial number: 2716057), who works at
            Planet Express as Assistant Manager of Sales, formerly chef of the company. He is one of the main characters
            and is known for his "in-your-face interface".Bender is often mean and disrespectful in regards to other
            people's feelings. At one point, he flushed Leela's beloved pet Nibbler down the toilet, and didn't feel bad
            about it until the Professor attached an empathy chip to his head, forcing him to feel other people's
            emotions. He is also quite arrogant, frequently bragging about how great he is. Bender has no emotion about
            committing crimes and often steals people's wallets or items from shops. He loves smoking and drinking,
            though as a robot he has to drink alcohol to keep him going. (The cigars just make him look cool.) Bender
            can also be cruel at times and even sometimes treats his own friends badly. He is also extremely lazy, and
            is often seen sitting around on the couch drinking a beer and/or watching television.
        </li>
        <li class="crew-item col-6">Turanga Leela is one of the most important employees of Planet Express. She occupies
            the position of the ship's captain and pilot and therefore is the head of the regular delivery crew
            consisting of herself, Fry, and Bender. She is known as the most competent of the three main characters.
            Leela is also highly skilled in martial arts which has been shown on numerous occasions.Leela grew up in the
            orphanarium unaware of her true roots, believing that she was indeed an alien. She had a hard time there, as
            she was relentlessly picked on because of her unusual appearance, and was always a lonely outsider. As a
            child she wore a monocle and, later, braces. Nevertheless, or maybe because of this, she managed to develop
            a strong and caring personality. As an outlet for her deep frustration, she trained in Arcturan Kung Fu to
            the level of a black-belt by a master of this martial art, Fnog, despite being a victim of his obvious
            sexism.

        <li class="crew-item col-6">Amy Wong, Ph.D., is a human from Mars who is of Chinese descent, sole heir to half
            the planet, and a Doctor of Applied Physics. She is a primary character and is known as a klutz and
            socialite. She is always seen wearing her pink outfit pictured to the right, because of the pressure from
            her extremely wealthy parents to look smart and presentable, but she doesn't like this idea.
            Despite her usual intelligence, Amy can be absent-minded. A notable example being removing Dr. Zoidberg's
            restraints no less than eight times, despite injuries she endured each time. Amy also has little concept of
            money, having offered to pay more for a hovercar than its sticker price and needing to be reminded by Leela
            that $10,000 is more than $5,000.
        </li>
        <li class="crew-item col-6">Hermes Conrad is a Jamaican Rastafarian and grade 36 Bureaucrat, and proud of it. He
            works at Planet Express, handling stamping, filing, collating, and accounting - all the fiddly little
            paperwork that only a true bureaucrat can handle properly. He claims, however, that he is only anal 78.36%
            of the time. He is also an honorary Globetrotter, and has worked for Mom's Friendly Robot Company as
            Inspector #5. He lives with his family in an apartment.During his adult life, Hermes became an Olympic grade
            limboer. It was around this time that he married LaBarbara, the ex-wife of his rival Barbados Slim. On his
            honeymoon, he limboed for 12 straight hours. When competing for the Earth team in 2980 a young fan trying to
            emulate him ran onto the field and snapped his spine, killing him, Hermes dropped out of professional limbo
            immediately after the tragic accident. Turning to his other passion, Hermes and his wife moved to New New
            York, home to the Central Bureaucracy and the couple had a son, Dwight.

        </li>
        <li class="crew-item col-6">Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth is an aged, eccentric, yet accomplished inventor,
            founder and owner of Planet Express and an honorary Globetrotter. He is crotchety, absent-minded and
            sometimes brilliant, most well-known for his work in 30th century robotics. In 2999, he was the last known
            relative of Philip J. Fry. Later, Professor Farnsworth discovered that he had fathered a son, as well as the
            clone that he had kept hidden. In addition, he also serves as a tenured professor at Mars University
            teaching the Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. Farnsworth is an inventor of both useful and
            impractical things, some of which are extremely dangerous, such as his Doomsday devices.
            Personality-wise, he varies from callous disregard to sentimental affection. He has no objection to sending
            his crew on missions which may eventually kill them, and has sent previous crews to their deaths before. (At
            times, he even seems eager to send crews on life-threatening missions.) Farnsworth is the oldest living
            member of the Academy of Inventors, where he often competes with his arch nemesis, Dr. Ogden Wernstrom.
        </li>
        <li class="crew-item col-6">Dr. John A. Zoidberg, commonly referred by his last name Zoidberg, is a Decapodian
            employed as staff doctor at Planet Express and an honorary Globetrotter. He is only
            tolerated at Planet Express because of his ability to cut things. An extremely poor man and a doctor
            of art history, he is still lovable to many and hated by others. Desperate for acceptance, Zoidberg lives
            with a continuing delusion that he is well regarded by the rest of the Planet Express crew. He does appear
            to be rather intelligent, but he is an inept medical practitioner. Most of his co-workers look down on him,
            especially Hermes, who likes to make his life even more miserable. Dr. Zoidberg is Professor Farnsworth's
            oldest friend, which suggests that Zoidberg is much older than he appears. A citizen of Earth, he loves his
            chosen home planet for the personal freedom it provides. He is also apparently the only intelligent
            organism on Earth deemed nice by the Robot Santa Claus. It is unknown why, but it may be because of
            a glitch in Santa or because of Zoidberg's kind and innocent personality. Other than the professor, the only
            people known to identify him as a friend are the members of the First Planet Express crew, Fry (sometimes),
            Mom and his girlfriend.
